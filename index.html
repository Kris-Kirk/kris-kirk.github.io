        <h2>Hi, my name is Kris and I am an eager learner who enjoys finding creative solutions to challenging problems. As a creative thinker who can learn and apply knowledge quickly, I have chosen to pursue Engineering Physics at UBC. Within the Engineering Physics program, I focus on developing a strong foundation of advanced math and physics, while taking courses on Mechanical, Electrical, and Software Engineering, in order to become a well-rounded individual with a background in a variety of disciplines.
            When I am not at pursuing Engineering, I enjoy coaching swimming and diving. I am the Head Coach of the Diving program for the North Vancouver Cruisers Aquatics Club, but have previously been the head coach of the speed swimming program as well.</h2>
        <h3>Work Experience</h3>
        <h2>I am fortunate to be involved in the UBC Coop program and have had two coops so far. My first coop was with DarkVision technologies, where I worked with the mechanical / mechatronics engineering teams to develop installation jigs and equipment and conduct a variety of mechanical and electrical tests. My second coop is with D-Wave Systems, where I am working in the lab to help build and run their Quantum Computers. Specifically, I am helping to assemmble and operate the vaccuum chambers and dilution refridgerators.</h2>
